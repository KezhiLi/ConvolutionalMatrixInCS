# ConvolutionalMatrixInCS
codes for the structured sensing matrices using deterministic sequences

The codes for:

1. Strucutred convolutional sensing matrix construction using deterministic sequences, including

deterministic sequences: Golay sequence, Golay complementay sequence, Legendre sequence, zadoff-chu sequence, m-sequence, extended polyphase sequence, etc.

2. Using various reconstruction algorithms, including:

omp, Samp, CoSaMp, Subspace pursuit, sbhe, etc.
