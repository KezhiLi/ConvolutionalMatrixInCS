# ConvolutionalMatrixInCS
codes for the structured sensing matrices using deterministic sequences. The main function is in "demo_real_Official.m" and "demo_real_official_1.m"

The codes for:

1. Strucutred convolutional sensing matrix construction using deterministic sequences, including

deterministic sequences with matlab codes: Golay sequence, Golay complementay sequence, Legendre sequence, zadoff-chu sequence, m-sequence, extended polyphase sequence, etc.  

2. Using various reconstruction algorithms, including:

reconstruction algorithms  with matlab codes: omp, Samp, CoSaMp, Subspace pursuit, sbhe, RecPF solves, etc.
